## Structure
The website has been structured with 5 web pages (including a 404 error page). Each page is cleary designed, easy to navigate, and with well layed out information. With a mobile first approach in mind I have used bootstrap throughout to make the site respoinsive on mobile devices.

> The 4 pages are:
> 1. Home Page: A carousel with 3 large clear images of the band, a brieft history of the band and intro to the band members, new tour dates anounced section, the latest video displayed, a new music section, classic Reef songs from back catalogue.

> 3. Media Page: A page that has a single column of 3 videos displayed and pictures layed in masonry format.
> 4. Bookings Page: A background image of the bass player with a contact form overlayed.
> 5. 404: This alerts users if they have entered an incorrect URL for the site. The user is presented with warning message, navbar, footer and button to back to Home Page.

## Skeleton
To design and develop the wireframes I first used Balsamiq, then used Snipping Tools to create PNG versions. The wireframes images are designed to collaspe.

## Surface
## Colours
Each page is design with very simple colours and images to showcase the island. The colours I have used are as follows:
> - #FFCC51 - used as a background color for the footer and navbar
> - #050505 - used for the site brand and nav links
> - #009688 - used to style the quiz text.

## Typography
Throughout the site I have used 3 Google Fonts chosen for their modern, but clean look and readability. 
All fonts below will fall back to Sans-Serif if Google Font cannot be read by browser.

Nav links, navbar brand, h1 main-headings (Home and Bio page).
> - [RocknRoll+One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/RocknRoll+One?query=RocknRoll+One)  

Sub heading (Home Page), h6 card headings, card title and text, p tags in video cards.
> - [Anton](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Anton?query=Anton)

Band Intro
> - [Antonio](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Antonio?query=Antonio)

## Imagery
Througout the site I have used clear images showcasing Santorini's natural beauty.

## Design
