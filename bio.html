<h1>Biography</h1>
<h2>Reef</h2>
<!--Biography credited to Stephen Thomas Erlewine - "https://www.allmusic.com/artist/reef-mn0000885138/biography"-->
<p>Emerging at the height of Brit-pop, Reef had little in common with their British peers; instead of sounding like an amalgam of the Beatles, the Jam, and Stone Roses,
they were indebted to the Stones and the Black Crowes. But, through constant touring, as well as being featured in a television commercial for Sony's Minidisc player, 
they managed to cultivate a large fan base that expanded significantly with the release of their breakout album Glow.</p>

<p>Comprised of Gary Stringer (vocals), Kenwyn House (guitar), Jack Bessant (bass), and Dominic Greensmith (drums), Reef formed in Street, England, a small town outside of Glastonbury. 
Initially named Big Talk, Stringer and Bessant were the core members of the group and House rejected their initial overture to join the band. 

</p>The new band became Chief. After a few months, Chief broke up; its drummer, Paul Winterhart, would later join Kula Shaker. 
Stringer and Bessant split temporarily as they traveled the world to find themselves. Bessant returned to England, where he began studying music at the West London Institute
and met House and Greensmith. Shortly afterward, Stringer returned to London, and all four musicians formed Naked. The band recorded a handful of demos in the fall of 1993, 
sending the results, titled "The Purple Tape," to S2, a subsidiary of Sony Records. S2 signed the group but asked them to change their name; the group settled on Reef. 
The label had Reef tour the U.K., and after a few months, the group graduated to headlining appearances, eventually opening for Paul Weller at the Royal Albert Hall in 1994.</p>

<p>In March of 1995, the group released their debut single, "Good Feeling," which climbed into the Top 20. A few months later, Reef contributed "Naked" for a television commercial
for the Sony Mini-Disc player. The commercial substantially increased the size of Reef's audience, and shortly afterward, "Naked" reached number 11. Both singles were from their 
1995 debut, Replenish, which climbed into the U.K. Top 10 and received good reviews from British metal publications. Following performances at summer festivals, the band released
the non-LP "Weird," which became their third Top 20 hit. On the strength of constant touring, including opening slots for the Rolling Stones and Soundgarden, Replenish reached the U.K. Top 10 in early 1996.</p>
